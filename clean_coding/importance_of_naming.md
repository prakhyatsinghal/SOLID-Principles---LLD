1. Naming Plays a crucial role in code clarity and cleaness.

2. Hard coded Numeric Values and random variable names are a bit frustrating and irritating for a person who is trying to understand the logic behind the code.

3. Example d = b - a   vs  displacement = finalPosition - initialPosition , the latter one is more readable and understandable.

4. Only original Coder / writer / programmer knows the use of variables which were named randomly , another developer will face difficulties while understanding the logic , and even there are chances that he/she wonâ€™t be able to decode some variable use.

5. Named variables make sense in the code and reveal most of the logic about code.

6. We should always use proper statically defined name variables for constant. And we should minimize the use of hard coded numeric values and magic numbers in the code.

7. Readability increases fold time with proper naming convention in the code.
